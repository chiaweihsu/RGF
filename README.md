# RGF
RGF is a finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) solver that uses the Recursive Green's function method to solve the scattering matrix (or a portion of it) of a user-specified structure. It solves Maxwell's equations for 2D TM modes (cal_smatrix_RGF.m) or the 3D scalar wave equation (cal_smatrix_RGF_3D.m) discretized with finite difference. The user-specified structure can have an arbitrary refractive index profile (which can be complex-valued to describe linear gain or absorption) and is surrounded by infinite homogeneous spaces on the left and right sides, with periodic, Bloch periodic, or Dirichlet boundary condition in the transverse direction(s).

RGF solves the discretized wave equation with no additional approximation. The scattering matrix is normalized by the longitudinal flux, so that the full scattering matrix is unitary if the refractive index profile is real-valued. RGF supports complex-valued frequency, i.e. it can return the scattering matrix analytically continued from a real frequency to an arbitrary complex frequency.

Detailed usage and explanation are given in the first contiguous comment lines, also shown with command "help cal_smatrix_RGF" or "help cal_smatrix_RGF_3D" in MATLAB. For basic usage, see example_script.m and example_script_3D.m.
